The paddles move vertically within the window boundaries and do not overlap the top or bottom walls.
2. Ball:
The ball bounces off the paddles and the top/bottom walls.
The ballâ€™s speed is adjusted at the start of each round after a player scores.

The game tracks the score of both players.
When the ball passes one of the paddles, the opposing player scores a point.
The ball is reset to the center of the screen after each point.
